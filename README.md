### Project Title

**Interactive StoryBuilder: A Dynamic Story Creation App for Kids**

---

### What and Why?

**Software System Description:**

We propose developing an interactive storybook app designed for children aged 7 to 11 in non-English-speaking countries. The app will use artificial intelligence to generate dynamic textual content and illustrations based on user input. Children will engage with the app by answering questions at key points in the story, which will influence the narrative and illustrations generated in real-time. Additionally, the app will feature text-to-speech functionality to narrate the story and present bilingual questions at the end to encourage language learning and comprehension.

**Problem Solved:**

This app addresses the lack of interactive, educational, and engaging content available for young children who are non-native English speakers. By involving children in the story creation process, the app enhances their creativity, language skills, and comprehension while providing a personalized and immersive learning experience.

### For Whom?

**Target Users:**

The primary users of this software are children aged 7 to 11 from non-English-speaking countries. Secondary users include their parents and educators who seek interactive educational tools that support language development and creativity.

**End-User Profile:**

- **Children:** They are at a developmental stage where they enjoy storytelling and interactive play. They benefit from personalized content that matches their interests and learning pace.
- **Parents/Educators:** They are looking for educational tools that can supplement traditional learning methods and foster language skills in a fun, engaging manner.

### How?

**System Functionality:**

1. **Story Creation:**
   - Children select a story theme or genre.
   - At key decision points, the app prompts the child with questions related to the story.
   - User responses drive the narrative and image generation through AI.

2. **Dynamic Content Generation:**
   - AI algorithms generate text and illustrations based on user input.
   - The app uses natural language processing to tailor the story and visual elements to the child’s responses.

3. **Audio Narration:**
   - Text-to-speech technology reads the story aloud in the child’s native language.
   - The app supports dual-language functionality, providing translations and questions in both the native language and English.

4. **Interactive Questions:**
   - At the end of each story segment, the app poses a bilingual question.
   - User responses are analyzed to influence subsequent story elements, promoting engagement and language practice.

### Scope

**Justification:**

The project is well-suited for a team of 4-6 programmers within a semester. It combines several core elements:
- AI-driven content and image generation.
- Text-to-speech and bilingual support.
- User interaction and dynamic storytelling.

The scope includes developing a functional prototype with key features: interactive story creation, dynamic content generation, audio narration, and bilingual interaction. This balance ensures the project is achievable within the timeframe while providing a valuable and engaging tool for the target audience.
